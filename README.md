# Rare: The Publishing Platform for the Discerning Writer

This is a learning project. Our goals were to practice full stack development by creating a React client and Python-Django back end.

This project was completed in 2 agile-scrum sprints.

During week one, we developed the back end using pure Python + SQL. The repo can be found here: 
https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-60/rare-python-server-glorious-g-s

We also developed the front end using React.js. The repo can be found here:

During week two, we re-wrote the back end using the Django framework in this current repo.
The styling in this project was implemented using Material UI.
